# Tasklist
Tasklist repo

Overview:
Its a maven project built using BDD Cucumber + Page Object model design pattern + Junit Runner with Core Java 1.8
I have used eclipse IDE and built using mvn test. You can use cmd prompt also to execute the test.
The index.html reports, json reports, junit xml test reports are also uploaded to the repo.

Thanks!
